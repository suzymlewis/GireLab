%% GRAB RAW CA DATA AND USE CNMF TO GET ROI MASKS ONLY
%% IMPORT GLOM DATA

% Import glomerular data file
[fg, fdg] = uigetfile('.mat', 'CHOOSE GLOMULAR DATA - .mat');
cd(fdg);
g_data = load(fg);

trials = g_data.trials;
ODOR_ON = g_data.ODOR_ON; % Index for relevant analysis time of video 
    % Keeps baseline 10 seconds before odor presentation    
    % Dumps a few seconds at tail end when no odor present
        % This ensures all trials have the same length
A_or = g_data.A_or; % Spatial Matrix from CNMF segmentation
session_length = g_data.y; % Number of trials to be analyzed over session
    % This number can vary if trials need to be dropped or are accidently
    % not recorded
frame_trial = g_data.tr; % What trial each frame is from
Y = g_data.Y; % Grab indices for ROI masks for each glomeruli
    % Y is M x N x Frames concatenated across all trials

%% USE ROI TO EXTRACT RAW CA DATA FROM COMPRESSED RECORDING

% Import compressed recording
[fc, fdc] = uigetfile('.mat', 'CHOOSE GLOMULAR DATA - .mat');
cd(fdc);
comp = load(fc);

% Extract relevant variable
Y_ca = comp.clc; % Downsampled raw data using median filter for neighboring pixels
Y_trialframe = comp.tr1a; % Vector containing trial assignment for each frame

% Clear compressed file to free memory
clear comp
