function [velocity acceleration] = kinematics(smooth_pos, smooth)
% The speed vector was then calculated based on the displacement between each time point
    % Consistent with previous studies (Geisler et al., 2007).
% The kinematic signals (e.g. speed, acceleration, deceleration) are primarily low-pass in nature such that the coherence between theta amplitude and the unfiltered biomechanical signals is maximal at frequencies less than 0.5 Hz
    % So low-pass filter (0.25 Hz) the kinematic signals in order to remove uncertainty by filtering out non-coherent, higher frequency signals in order to enhance the ability to observe correlations between theta and the relevant biomechanical signals 
% Further, acceleration was calculated by taking the 2nd order finite difference with regards to position followed by the same low-pass filter applied to the speed signal

%    Speed calculation—The center of mass of the coordinates of the red and green LEDs on
% the rat’s head were computed offline. This represented the x and y position of the rat at each
% point in time. This position data was low pass filtered to remove noise (Geisler et al., 2007).
% The speed vector was then calculated based on the displacement between each time point,
% consistent with previous studies (Geisler et al., 2007).

%% THINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE CODED FOR THIS FUNCTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    Convert to cm
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    To do this need to find good way to convert tracking pts to maze dimensions without error
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%       Low Pass Fitler
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%       To do this need to interp even sampled timepoints and get exact sampling freq to create butterworth filter


%% FIND TIME ELASPED BETWEEN POSITIONAL COORDINATE PAIRS
vel_time_diff = diff(smooth_pos(2:end, 4)); % Find difference in ms timervalue
acc_time_diff = vel_time_diff(:, 2:end); % For acceleration since 2nd order diff need to drop first entry of array so timepoints match kinematic measurements positionally

%% NORMALIZE COORDINATES
maxima = [max(smooth_pos(:, 1)) max(smooth_pos(:, 2))];
minima = [min(smooth_pos(:, 1)) min(smooth_pos(:, 2))];
normalized = (smooth_pos(:,1:2)- minima)./(maxima-minima); % Subtract minimum from each dimensions then divide by new maximum

%% CALCULATE VELOCITY 
% First find distance between each pair of timepoints in each dimension
DX = diff(normalized); % Get difference between coordinates along each dimension

%Quadratic Equation to find distance traveled between each timepoint
Sqr = DX(:,1:2).*DX(:,1:2);   % Square distance
distance = sqrt(Sqr(:,1)+Sqr(:,2));    % Take square of their sum

% Find velocity via finite differentiation
velocity = (diff(distance))./vel_time_diff;

% Add both OE timestamps and computer ms timervalues
velocity(:,2:3) = smooth_pos(2:end, 3:4);

%% CALCULATE ACCELERATION
acceleration = diff(velocity(:,1));

% Add both OE timestamps and computer ms timervalues
acceleration(:,2:3) = smooth_pos(2:end, 3:4);

        % Filtering out non-coherent, higher frequency signals

        % Enhances ability to observe correlations between theta and the relevant biomechanical signals
Fs=30000; %sampling rate
n=4; %filter order, integral
fcutoff=0.25; % Set threshold
[b,a]=butter(n,fcutoff/(Fs/2)); % Butterworth auto lowpass filter
POS_filter(:,1:2) = filtfilt(b,a,POS(:,1:2)); %filter positional data across rows, since 2Xn transpose so timepoints across rows
